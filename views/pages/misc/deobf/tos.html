      The Wisp protocol is designed to handle modern web traffic demands while
      maintaining high security standards. By implementing Wisp, HU LTS
      leverages the following benefits:
    </p>
    <p>
      Enhanced Performance: The Wisp protocol optimizes data transfer speeds,
      ensuring that users experience minimal latency while browsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Improved Compatibility: Wisp is built to be compatible with a wide range
      of web technologies, ensuring seamless access to various websites and
      online services.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resilience Against Censorship: The protocol is designed to bypass
      sophisticated censorship techniques employed by restrictive networks,
      allowing users to access blocked content with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong Fingerprint Resistance: HU LTS employs strong fingerprint
      resistance mechanisms within its reverse proxy setup for official
      instances. This means that the proxy is designed to minimize the unique
      identifiers that can be used to track or identify users, thereby enhancing
      privacy. By following industry best practices and continually updating its
      methods, HU LTS ensures that users can browse anonymously without leaving
      identifiable traces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Transparency: Transparency is a key principle for HU LTS. The project
      operates with an open-source model, allowing the community to review and
      contribute to the codebase. This openness not only fosters trust but also
      enables continuous improvement through community feedback and
      collaboration. By adhering to transparent practices, HU LTS ensures that
      users are aware of how their data is handled and what measures are in
      place to protect their privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      URL Rewriting: HU LTS employs URL rewriting techniques to maintain
      seamless browsing experiences while ensuring that the actual URLs accessed
      remain obfuscated, adding an additional layer of security.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encryption: HU LTS utilizes advanced proxy technologies that focus on
      encryption and secure data transfer, particularly in the context of URL
      rewriting proxies. NOTE: This is still a massive work in progress and open
      to contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regular Audits: Conducting regular security audits to identify and address
      potential vulnerabilities.
